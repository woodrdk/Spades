	cout << "The entire deck is dealt one at a time, face down, beginning on the dealer's left. " << endl;
	cout << "The players then pick up their cards and arrange them by suits." << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "THE BIDDING:" << endl;
	cout << "Each player decides how many tricks they will be able to take." << endl;
	cout << "The player to the dealer's left starts the bidding and, in turn, each player states how many tricks they expect to win." << endl;
	cout << "There is only one round of bidding, and the minimum bid is One." << endl;
	cout << "Every player must make a bid; no player may pass. " << endl;
	cout << "No suit is named in the bid, for as the name of the game implies, spades are always trump." << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "THE PLAY:" << endl;
	cout << "The game is scored by hands, and the winner must make a certain number of points, which is decided before the game begins." << endl;
	cout << "Five hundred points is common, but 200 points is suitable for a short game." << endl;
	cout << "The player on the dealer's left makes the opening lead, and players must follow suit, if possible."<< endl;
	cout << "If a player cannot follow suit, they may play a trump or discard."<< endl;
	cout << "The trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or if no trump was played, the player who played the highest card in the suit led. "<< endl;
	cout << "The player who wins the trick leads next. Play continues until none of the players have any cards left. Each hand is worth 13 tricks."<< endl;
	cout << "Spades cannot be led unless played previously or player to lead has nothing but Spades in his hand." << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "HOW TO KEEP SCORE:" << endl;
	cout << "For making the contract(the number of tricks bid), the player scores 10 points for each trick bid, plus 1 point for each overtrick." << endl;
	cout << "For example, if the player's bid is Seven and they make seven tricks, the score would be 70." << endl;
	cout << "If the bid was Five and the player won eight tricks, the score would be 53 points: 50 points for the bid, and 3 points for the three overtricks." << endl;
	cout << "In some games, overtricks are called \"bags\" and a deduction of 100 points is made every time a player accumulates 10 bags." << endl;
	cout << "Thus, the object is always to fulfill the bid exactly." << endl;
	cout << "If the player \"breaks contract,\" that is, if they take fewer than the number of tricks bid, the score is 0. " << endl;
	cout << "For example, if a player bids Fourand wins only three tricks, no points are awarded." << endl;
	cout << "One of the players is the scorerand writes the bids down, so that during the playand for the scoring afterward, this information will be available to all the players. " << endl;
	cout << "When a hand is over, the scores should be recorded next to the bids, and a running score should be kept so that players can readily see each other's total points. " << endl;
	cout << "If there is a tie, then all players participate in one more round of play." << endl << endl;
